This middleware is available in Express v4.16.0 onwards.

The JSON.parse() method converts a JSON value to a javascript object

This is a built-in middleware function in Express. It parses incoming requests with
 JSON payloads and is based on body-parser.
Returns middleware that only parses JSON and only looks at requests where
 the Content-Type header matches the type option. 

A new body object containing the parsed data is populated on the request object after the 
middleware (i.e. req.body), or an empty object ({}) if there was no body to parse, 
the Content-Type was not matched, or an error occurred.
